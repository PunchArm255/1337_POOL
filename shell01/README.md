More shit to keep in mind in case the Bocal call curse gets to you...

### `groups $FT_USER | tr ' ' ',' | tr -d '\n'`

- **`groups $FT_USER`**: Lists the groups to which the user `$FT_USER` belongs.
- **`|`**: Pipes the output of the previous command to the next command.
- **`tr ' ' ','`**: Translates (replaces) spaces with commas.
- **`tr -d '\n'`**: Deletes newlines from the output.

### `find . -name "*.sh" -print | xargs basename -s .sh`

- **`find .`**: Searches in the current directory and its subdirectories.
- **`name "*.sh"`**: Looks for files with the `.sh` extension.
- **`print`**: Prints the full file names.
- **`|`**: Pipes the output of the previous command to the next command.
- **`xargs`**: Constructs argument lists and executes the command for each.
- **`basename -s .sh`**: Strips the directory and file extension from each file name, leaving just the base name.

### `find . | wc -l | tr -d ' '`

- **`find .`**: Searches in the current directory and its subdirectories.
- **`|`**: Pipes the output of the previous command to the next command.
- **`wc -l`**: Counts the number of lines (i.e., the number of items found by `find`).
- **`tr -d ' '`**: Deletes spaces from the output.

### `ifconfig | grep "ether " | cut -d ' ' -f 2`

- **`ifconfig`**: Displays network configuration details.
- **`|`**: Pipes the output of the previous command to the next command.
- **`grep "ether "`**: Searches for lines containing the word "ether" (used to find the MAC address).
- **`cut -d ' ' -f 2`**: Uses a space as the delimiter and selects the second field (the MAC address).

### `ls -l | sed -n "p;n"`

- **`ls -l`**: Lists files in the current directory in long format.
- **`|`**: Pipes the output of the previous command to the next command.
- **`sed -n "p;n"`**: Uses `sed` to print every other line starting from the first line (prints the first line, skips the second, prints the third, etc.).

### Pipes (`|`)

- **Function**: Pipes take the output of one command and use it as the input for another command.
- **Usage**: `command1 | command2`
    - **Example**: `ls -l | grep "test"`: This command lists files in long format and then filters the list to show only lines containing "test".

### `xargs`

- **Function**: Builds and executes command lines from standard input.
- **Usage**: `command1 | xargs command2`
    - **Example**: `find . -name "*.txt" | xargs rm`: This command finds all `.txt` files and removes them.
- **Key Features**:
    - Takes input from the preceding command and uses it as arguments for the specified command.
    - Useful for commands that do not accept standard input directly.

### `cut -d ' ' -f 2`

- **Function**: Cuts out sections from each line of files or input based on a delimiter.
- **Usage**: `command | cut -d 'delimiter' -f field_number`
    - **Example**: `echo "apple orange banana" | cut -d ' ' -f 2` outputs `orange`.
    - **`d ' '`**: Specifies the delimiter (space in this case).
    - **`f 2`**: Specifies the field number to extract (second field in this case).

### `sed -n`

- **Function**: Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
- **Usage**: `command | sed -n 'p;n'`
    - **Example**: `ls -l | sed -n 'p;n'`: Prints every other line of the `ls -l` output.
- **Key Commands**:
    - **`n`**: Suppresses automatic printing of pattern space.
    - **`p`**: Prints the current pattern space.
    - **`n`**: Skips the next line.

### Summary

- **Pipes (`|`)**: Link commands, passing the output of one as the input to another.
- **`xargs`**: Constructs command lines from standard input, useful for commands that need arguments.
- **`cut -d ' ' -f 2`**: Splits input by a delimiter and extracts the specified field.
- **`sed -n`**: Stream editor to selectively print or manipulate text based on patterns.
